##### Where did I start

I start my development and digital career studying digital design. after taking a couple of programming classes I realize that code is what I wanted to be doing, so I start learning by myself. I eventually became good at writing CSS and that's how I got my first development job as a Junior frontend developer.

because of my hybrid background, I always got stock between designers and developers, and what I end up doing in almost all the companies I worked with was **helping both designers and developers understand more the other side**, I think this is critical for a product team to become successful.

##### Freelancing

After a couple of years working in companies I decided to risk myself and go do freelancing. I got the oportunity to help and build multiple types of websites and products, and **help in almost all phases of the product creation**, from start to finish.

##### Teaching

in 2017 I met [Alex](https://twitter.com/alex_lobera) and he gave me the oportunity to start teaching to other developers about React, Redux, GraphQl and React Native in his company [React GraphQl Academy](https://reactgraphql.academy/). I can confirm, **teaching is one of my personal revelations or the year**. I couldn't imagine how much I enjoy teaching and help other learn new technologies and techniques.

> **Teaching is one of the best ways to learn, because it forces you to deep dive into the topic in hand to a high level of understanding.**

My recommendation for you is that you should try to teach, it does not have to be in a class, it can be to your colleague, online or wherever you feel confortable. Trust me, it will save you a ton of time.

Now I'm not only teaching onsite with React GraphQL Academy, but also online on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/horacioh) (and here's my another revelation for me üò¨)

##### What I'm doing now?

well, starting 2020 I'm working on my first startup: **Mintter**. Is a publishing platform that works on top of Bitcoin ‚ö°Ô∏è.

I'm super excited about this because involves so many new technologies and I'm very sure things like Mintter will change the way we use internet and Digital Knowledge.
